      The home page has no fields. All content is automatically pulled in from other parts of the site.

      * Upcoming shows are dynamically pulled in from the <a href="/panel/pages/performances/edit">Performances</a> page. Kirby will compare each performance date with the todayâ€™s date. Once the date has past, the performance will no longer display on the home page.

      * The most recently published post is pulled from the Archive.
